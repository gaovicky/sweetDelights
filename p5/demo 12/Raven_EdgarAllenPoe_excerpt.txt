Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore.
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore.
Sorrow for the lost Lenore.
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
Nameless here for evermore.
'T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door--
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door.
Here I opened wide the door;--
Darkness there, and nothing more.
